All the information I have been using for this program

The mix calculations use densities set out by the ASTM. these proportions always refer to volumes, not to weight These are:

Portland cement       94 lbs/cuft

Hydrated lime           40 lbs/cuft

Sand                         80 lbs/cuft

The purchased items are by these:

Portland cement       94 lb bags

Hydrated lime           50 lb bags

Sand                         by the ton

Gallons per cubic foot

1 cubic foot = 7.48051945 US gallons

1 US gallon = 0.133680556 cubic feet

a. based upon bag mix
5 bag mix or 470 lb per cubic yard = 2500 psi
5 1/2 bag mix or 517 lb per cubic yard= 3000 psi
6 bag mix or 564 lb per cubic yard = 3500 psi
6 1/2 bag mix or 611 lb per cubic yard= 4000 psi


some random site:
A concrete mixture ratio of 1 part cement, 3 parts sand, and 3 parts aggregate will produce a concrete mix of approximately 3000 psi.
Mixing water with the cement, sand, and stone will form a paste that will bind the materials together until the mix hardens. The strength properties of the concrete are inversely proportional to the water/cement ratio.
Basically this means the more water you use to mix the concrete (very fluid) the weaker the concrete mix. The less water you use to mix the concrete (somewhat dry but workable) the stronger the concrete mix.
Accurate concrete mixing ratios can be achieved by measuring the dry materials using buckets or some other kind of measuring device. By measuring the mixing ratios you will have a consistent concrete mix throughout your entire project.
To produce a 3000 psi cubic yard of concrete (27 cubic feet) the concrete mixture ratio is:
1. 517 pounds of cement
2. 1560 pounds of sand
3. 1600 pounds of stone
4. 32 - 34 gallons of water
Knowing the weight of the materials and how much water to use should help you determine how much cement, sand, and stone to purchase to complete your project.
For estimating purposes, you can make about 1 cubic yard of concrete with 5 1/2 94-pound bags of cement, 17 cubic feet of sand, and 18 cubic feet of gravel. (It takes about forty 80-pound bags of prepackaged materials to make 1 cubic yard of concrete.)
